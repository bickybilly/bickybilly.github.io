# Hi! :-)

<p class = "message">
My name is Vicky. I'm an art, science, and software enthusiast. I'm inspired by beautiful experiences, both organic and man-made. Of the latter, I'm especially interested in art, animation, music, video-games, and just about any kind of interface with a smooth, feels-so-good interaction. As a technologist, I hope to build tools to support the creation of such experiences.

#### Lately, I'm working on:

* a Masters degree in Human-Computer Interaction at the [University of Toronto](http://www.dgp.toronto.edu).
* my life-drawing and painting skills
