This is a project that has not yet been submitted for publication. To maintain anonymity for the reviewing process, I can't describe much about the project at the moment. What I can do is show off some **gifs of the iOS app** I built. If you're not a reviewier for any upcoming HCI conferences, click ahead!

An overview of my masters thesis development process:
- Cycling through various potential project topics
- Performing a literature review
- Exploring and classifying the problem space
- Designing and building a prototype
- Designing and running a user study
- Analyzed, coded, and summarized study results

The prototype was written in Swift, for iOS, and made extensive use of the Google Maps, Places, Directions, and Distance Matrix APIs. Take a look!

Looking forward to completing the submission soon. I'll post the paper and video here when the process is all said and done.
