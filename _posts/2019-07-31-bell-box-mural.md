The [Bell Box Murals Project](https://www.facebook.com/bellboxmuralsproject/) is a Toronto-based public arts program which aims to beautify community streets by replacing vandalism and graffiti with commissioned work by local artists. Through the program, I had the opportunity to design and paint an electrical box mural in the Discovery District of downtown Toronto.

The design is a mash-up of my typical stylized subject matter with technological themes. I wanted to leave my mark on the city by creating something that would be unmistakably mine, while also bringing light to the pervasiveness of computer science innovation in the area-- in industry, in academia, and in my own life, just steps away at U of T.

## Quick Facts

- Completed between July 14th and July 24th, 2019, during a minor heat wave.
- Estimated 30 hours spent at the box (did a lot of re-working, and a lot of chatting with curious strangers).
- Located on College Street, just west of University Avenue.
- Inspired by the title of the (excellent) Philip K. Dick novel, "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"

*The sticky weather made priming very difficult, especially when using brushes instead of rollers (rookie mistake).*

*Thanks for helping me prime, Jemar!*

*Coming along nicely here. You can still see some of my underlying chalk sketch.*

*Hey, that's me! B-)*

*Pretty much a whole 'nother mural on the back, too. The lighting makes it difficult to get a good photograph, but I'll get a better one some day.*

That's it! I'd be so happy continue painting murals in the future. I plan to keep applying to these city programs-- here's hoping!
