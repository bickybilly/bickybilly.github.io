The work I completed for my Masters Thesis at the DGP lab has not yet been submitted for publication. Our UIST submission needs some final touches-- I will update this when it's all wrapped up!

Postponing a full post on the project, here's a brief summary of the work I did:

- bounced around projects for quite a while, considering topics in Personal Informatics, Education, and Map Visualization before landing on the final idea
- lit review lit review lit review!
- UX/UI design sketching, paper prototyping
- built a functional prototype: an iOS app written Swift, making extensive use of the Google Maps, Places, and Directions APIs
- designed and performed a user study with 12 participants
- wrote my first full-length research paper!
